# PWM Frequency Change Test
# Test-ID: PWM-FREQ-001, PWM-FREQ-002, PWM-FREQ-003
# Validates PWM frequency configuration
# Note: Frequency changes require firmware-level test commands
# This test validates initial frequency configuration
# Timeout: 120000ms

name: PWM Frequency Configuration
version: 1
steps:
  # Wait for boot
  - wait-serial: "Boot started"

  # Verify default frequency in initialization log
  - wait-serial: "Freq=1000Hz"

  # Wait for full initialization
  - wait-serial: "PWM Controller initialized successfully"

  # Verify frequency is logged
  - wait-serial: "Default Frequency: 1000 Hz"

  # Wait for system ready
  - wait-serial: "MQTT connected"

  # Note: To test runtime frequency changes, firmware would need
  # to expose setFrequency() via MQTT command or diagnostic endpoint
