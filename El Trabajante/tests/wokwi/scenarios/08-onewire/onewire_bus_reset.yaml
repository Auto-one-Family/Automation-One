# OneWire Bus Reset Test (OW-INIT-004)
# Validates OneWire bus reset operation
# Tests: reset() called during readRawTemperature(), failure handling
# Timeout: 90000ms

name: OneWire Bus Reset Verification
version: 1
steps:
  # Boot with OneWire
  - wait-serial: "OneWire Bus Manager initialization started"

  # Bus reset is attempted during init
  # If no devices, warning logged but init continues
  # "OneWire bus reset failed - no devices present or bus error"
  # (This is warning, not error - bus can still be used)

  # Initialization succeeds regardless
  - wait-serial: "OneWire Bus Manager initialized successfully"

  # Phase 3 completes
  - wait-serial: "Phase 3: Hardware Abstraction READY"

  # When temperature is read, reset occurs before each operation
  # readRawTemperature() calls reset() twice (before command, before read)
