# OneWire ROM Length Validation Test (OW-ERR-003)
# Validates that ROM codes must be exactly 16 hex characters
# Tests: Invalid ROM length is rejected
# Timeout: 90000ms

name: OneWire ROM Length Validation
version: 1
steps:
  # Boot completes
  - wait-serial: "Phase 5: Actuator System READY"

  # OneWire bus ready
  - wait-serial: "OneWire Bus Manager"

  # When sensor config is processed, ROM length is validated
  # If ROM is not 16 chars, error would be:
  # "Invalid OneWire ROM-Code length (expected 16, got X)"

  # Valid configurations proceed normally
  - wait-serial: "heartbeat"

  # This test confirms the validation mechanism exists
  # Actual ROM length error would require MQTT injection of bad config
