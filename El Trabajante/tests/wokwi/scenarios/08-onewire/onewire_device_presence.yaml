# OneWire Device Presence Check Test (OW-DISC-003)
# Validates isDevicePresent() for specific ROM code
# Tests: Device presence verification before sensor configuration
# Timeout: 90000ms

name: OneWire Device Presence Check
version: 1
steps:
  # Boot completes
  - wait-serial: "Phase 5: Actuator System READY"

  # OneWire bus active
  - wait-serial: "OneWire Bus Manager"

  # When a DS18B20 sensor is configured, device presence is verified
  # This happens in SensorManager::configureSensor()
  # If device is found on bus:
  - wait-serial: "OneWire device"

  # Verified message confirms isDevicePresent() succeeded
  - wait-serial: "verified on GPIO"
