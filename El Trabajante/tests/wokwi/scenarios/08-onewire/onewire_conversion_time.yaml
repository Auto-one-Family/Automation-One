# OneWire Conversion Time Test (OW-TEMP-004)
# Validates 750ms conversion time is properly handled
# Tests: Temperature conversion waits for 12-bit resolution (750ms)
# Timeout: 90000ms

name: OneWire Conversion Time
version: 1
steps:
  # Boot completes
  - wait-serial: "Phase 5: Actuator System READY"

  # OneWire initialized
  - wait-serial: "OneWire Bus Manager"

  # When temperature is requested, 750ms delay occurs
  # (This is internal in readRawTemperature())
  # delay(750) ensures 12-bit conversion completes

  # After delay, scratchpad is read
  - wait-serial: "OneWire raw temperature"

  # Value is logged
  - wait-serial: "God-Kaiser"

  # System continues with heartbeat
  - wait-serial: "heartbeat"
