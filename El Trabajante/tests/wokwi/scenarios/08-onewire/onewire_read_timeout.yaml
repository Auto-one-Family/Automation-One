# OneWire Read Timeout Handling Test (OW-ERR-005)
# Validates timeout handling during temperature read
# Tests: Timeout detection during 750ms conversion wait
# Note: Wokwi simulation provides stable readings, actual timeouts unlikely
# Timeout: 90000ms

name: OneWire Read Timeout Handling
version: 1
steps:
  # Boot completes
  - wait-serial: "Phase 5: Actuator System READY"

  # OneWire bus initialized
  - wait-serial: "OneWire Bus Manager"

  # Temperature readings occur normally
  # If timeout occurred, would see:
  # "OneWire reset failed after conversion"
  # ERROR_ONEWIRE_READ_FAILED (1022) or ERROR_ONEWIRE_READ_TIMEOUT (1028)

  # In normal operation, readings succeed
  - wait-serial: "OneWire raw temperature"

  # System continues
  - wait-serial: "heartbeat"
