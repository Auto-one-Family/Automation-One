# I2C Bus Initialization Success Test
# Test-ID: I2C-INIT-001
# Validates: begin() returns true with default pins (GPIO 21/22, 100kHz)
# Expected: I2C Bus Manager initializes successfully in Phase 3
# Timeout: 90000ms

name: I2C Bus Initialization Success (I2C-INIT-001)
version: 1
steps:
  # Phase 1 completes (GPIO Manager must be ready first)
  - wait-serial: "Safe-Mode initialization complete"

  # Phase 3: Hardware Abstraction Layer starts
  - wait-serial: "Phase 3: Hardware Abstraction Layer"

  # I2C Config is logged
  - wait-serial: "I2C Config: SDA=21, SCL=22"

  # I2C Bus Manager initializes successfully
  - wait-serial: "I2C Bus Manager initialized successfully"

  # Board type is logged
  - wait-serial: "Board: ESP32_WROOM_32"

  # Pins are logged
  - wait-serial: "SDA: GPIO 21"
  - wait-serial: "SCL: GPIO 22"

  # Frequency is logged
  - wait-serial: "Frequency: 100 kHz"

  # Phase 3 completes with I2C confirmed
  - wait-serial: "Phase 3: Hardware Abstraction READY"
  - wait-serial: "I2C Bus Manager"
