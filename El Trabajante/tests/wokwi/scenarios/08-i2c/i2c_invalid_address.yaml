# I2C Invalid Address Range Test
# Test-ID: I2C-SCAN-006
# Validates: isDevicePresent() rejects addresses outside 0x08-0x77
# Expected: Error logged for reserved addresses (0x00-0x07, 0x78-0x7F)
# Timeout: 90000ms

version: 1
steps:
  # I2C Bus Manager initializes
  - wait-serial: "I2C Bus Manager initialized successfully"

  # Phase 3 completes
  - wait-serial: "Phase 3: Hardware Abstraction READY"

  # System operates normally without invalid address access
  - wait-serial: "Phase 4: Sensor System READY"

# NOTE: Full validation requires firmware test mode or MQTT command:
# Send config with i2c_address: 0x05 (reserved)
# Expected error: "Invalid I2C address: 0x05"
#
# Reserved I2C addresses:
# - 0x00-0x07: General call, START byte, CBUS, reserved
# - 0x78-0x7F: 10-bit addressing, reserved
