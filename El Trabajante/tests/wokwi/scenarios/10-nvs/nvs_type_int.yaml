# NVS Int Type Tests
# Test-ID: NVS-TYPE-004, NVS-TYPE-005
# Validates int8_t and int32_t storage and retrieval from NVS
# Timeout: 90000ms
#
# Signed integers are used for:
# - Calibration offsets
# - Temperature values (can be negative)
# - Error codes (some are negative)
#
# Expected behavior:
# - putInt() stores negative and positive values
# - getInt() retrieves value correctly
# - Full range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647

  # System boots
  - wait-serial: "ESP32 Sensor Network"
  - wait-serial: "StorageManager: Initialized"
  - wait-serial: "Phase 1: Core Infrastructure READY"

  # System uses various integer types
  - wait-serial: "WiFi connected successfully"
  - wait-serial: "MQTT connected successfully"

  # Stable operation proves integer handling works
  - wait-serial: "heartbeat"
